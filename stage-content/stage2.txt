The route doesn't relent for the second day. The morning starts with a rugged up and down route that will quickly warm up your legs. 

The route will lead down hill to the stream <i>Ruisseau de la Mandriaccia<i> where you can replenish your water if needed. 

From here you'll need to pick your way up towards the <i>Bocca Piccaia<i>. Zig-zagging your way through rocks and rough steps you'll get an exercise in a key skill of the GR20, picking out the white and red marks on rocks. 

These markings are prodigious on the route. A good guide to keep in mind is that if you go 50 meters or so without seeing one, you might be wandering from the path. 

After one last steep ascent you'll top out on the <i>Bocca Piccaia<i>. Enjoy another fine view and take a break.

The next section includes some up and down scrambling and you'll have to take extra care to follow the red and white markings so you don't stray from the path. 

The day ends with a steep and very rugged descent that will test your tired legs and knees. Take it slow even if you can see the roof of the <i>Refuge de Carozzu<i> getting tantalizingly closer. 

The Refuge is in a lovely wooded area, with lots of space to camp in hidden pitches. There is a good kitchen for making your own meals and a great wooden terrace with a view down the valley.
