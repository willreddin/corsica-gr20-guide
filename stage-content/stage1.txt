refuge - Refuge d'Ortu

You'll start the journey almost certainly from the campsite at Calenzana. it's a nice functional campsite with good pitches and good facilities. Make the most of them because the refuges will get much more rustic and basic in the next few days!

Prepare yourself; the first stage is a long one with alot of ascent. From the very start you will be walking up hill through Calenzana and the rest of the day will almost all consist of ascending into the mountains of Corsica.

If you are doing the walk in the summer months you should always aim to start early and try to avoid the worst of the mid day sun. 

As you start on the trail you'll get to experience the lovely aroma of the 'Marquis', a term for the vegetation surrounding the mountain range. This brushland consists of a wide variety of wild herbs that gives the air an a deep mint aroma. 

You'll leave the Marquis fairly quickly as you ascend higher and will start getting into the rockier terrain that is more typical of the GR20. 

As you approach the <i>Bocca a u Bassiguella<i> you'll be introduced to the style of scrambling that is common on the Northern parts of the GR20. Be cautious although the scrambling is not ardious it can be difficult to maintain your balance if you are still getting used to carrying a heavy pack. 

You probably find a few other walkers taking a break at the <i>Bocca a u Bassiguella<i> a shoulder that provides some wonderful views of what is to come over the next few days. If you look back you'll also see a breath-taking view of the Corsican coast. 

The rest of the day consists mainly of traversing around a shoulder on easy gradients before a final short steep climb to the <i>Refuge d'Ortu<i>.

If your experience is anything like mine you will find a well stocked refuge with lots of good flat camping pitches. Try enjoying a refreshing local Pietra beer while watching the sunset over the mountains.
